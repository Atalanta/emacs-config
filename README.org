#+TITLE: SNS Emacs Config

* Overview
This repo contains my emacs config, and snippets of lisp that I find useful.  It's currently dreadfully out of date, but I'm going to start porting stuff over from various places.
* Usage
The simplest way to use this is simply to clone it thus:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
cd $HOME
git clone git://github.com/Atalanta/emacs-config.git .emacs.d
#+END_EXAMPLE

This is currently only tested on Emacs 24 on OSX.
